# esp32_audio_recording_SD
Using esp32 to record the audio and store in the SD card

# Citation
This reponsitory uses several Github links that two or three years old that already exist:
https://github.com/MhageGH/esp32_SoundRecorder
https://github.com/atomic14/esp32_sdcard_audio/tree/main/arduino-wav-sdcard

# Introduction
However, there are some bugs in these links. For example, the API parameters in the code were no longer applicable to the current version of Arduino 1.8.19.

Hence,I have ried to solve all possible known problems, not only the SD card connection, but also the audio writing problem of our I2S. I hope you can make advantage of this.
